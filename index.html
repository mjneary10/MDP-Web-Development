          <h3>Perfect for beginners or upskilling</h3>
          <p>This course is created with beginners in mind. Step by step, you will learn industry ready web development.
            Each module has summaries, test and debugging, and quizzes to assist in learning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Real world web development</h3>
          <p>The modules in this course have been created using technologies and techniques used in most web development
            companies. Web development best practises are also incorporated, using reputable online sources.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step by step learning, not copy and paste</h3>
          <p>Lots of training courses out there frustrate people, as they dont reinforce learning, instead, they allow
            you to use copy and paste code blocks. This method will not help in learning new techniques, or debugging
            issues.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Personal support & future refrence</h3>
          <p>Because I know how hard it can be to get started in web development, I am available to support you every
            step of our journey. Even into the future, this course will be a valuable source of refrence, should you
            wish to study further.</p>

      <h2>Hi, I'm Martin!</h2>

      <p>I am a software developer now for about 11 years, and started studying web development about 20 years ago (yes,
        on the dinosaur internet). I have a passion for web development, learning and teaching.</p>

      <p>I live on the lovely green island of Ireland, in Dublin, with my wife Michelle and daughter Shauna. I am
        origionally from Mayo and moved to Dublin in 2001, then met my wife in 2008, and had our little baby in 2015.

      </p>I donâ€™t want you to go through hundres of hours searching for how to learn web devellpment, so, I have put all
      my
      experience and knowledge into my online course, in one place. I have studied many courses myself over the last few
      years, some good, some bad, so my goal in life is to make my training courses the best they can be for you.
      </p>
      <p>Please join me on this journey into web development, it is such an exciting area to learn, I will support you
        every step of the way.</p>
